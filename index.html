      Bio:
    </font></p></h3>

    <p1><font size="8">
      Hey whatâ€™s up! I am a Girl Who Codes (jajaj get it). I am 16 years old and my birthday
      is coming up this summer. I am a rising senior at Jesse Bethel High School. I am pretty nervous
      for what senior year will bring me but I know everything will turn out smooth. I am from
      Vallejo which is pretty far from San Bruno so it takes a 2 hour commute to get here every morning.
    </font></p1>

    <h4><p><font face="Arial" size="8" color="Red">
      Interests:</font></p></h4>
    <p2><font size="8">
       I like being with my dog and finding out cool places to go out to eat. I enjoy going to the beach
       and exploring different cities. When I am in the city I enjoy going to art musuems. One of
       my favorite artists is Frida Kahlo and I plan on getting her face tattooed on my body. Self express
       is something I really like so I spend most of my time trying to switch up my style. For the most part
       I never have money but when I do I spend it all on clothes and makeup.
    </font></p2>

    <h5><p><font face="Arial" size="8" color="Red">
      Fun Facts:
    </font></p></h5>

    <p3><font size="8">
      When I was 6 I broke my elbow lol. I really love art but I suck at drawing. I have an older
      sister and we pretty much fight everyday, I think it's because we're both leos though. Despite
      our three year difference we are still really close but that's mainly because we've shared a
      room up until last year. And yea I'm pretty boring so I don't really know what else to put here.

    <h6><p><font face="Arial" size="8" color="Red">
      Favorite Websites:
    </font></p></h6>

    <p><font size="8"><a href= "https://twitter.com/"> Twitter</a>
      : I love laughing at funny memes and videos. Twitter is also dang near like my personal diary
      so I can get a bit annoying on there.
    </p>

    <p><a href= "https://www.youtube.com/">  Youtube</a>
      : I watch all kinds of videos! My watch history ranges from makeup tutorials, cooking videos
      and even funny pranks. When I was like 11 I wanted to become a youtuber but that dream never
      pulled through.
